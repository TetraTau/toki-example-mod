# Toki example mod
This example mod uses a modified version of [paperweight](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) called [Tokimak](https://github.com/TetraTau/tokimak) which adds support for the Mixin development in your Toki mods.
By default it uses Mojang Mappings, and for now there is no option to choose other mappings.
